<h3>Established in 2007, Educate Girls’ is a non-profit that focusses on mobilising communities for girls’ education in India’s rural and educationally backward areas.
Strongly aligned with the ‘Right to Education Act’ or the ‘Samagra Siksha'.
Educate Girls is committed to the Government’s vision to improve access to primary education for children, especially young girls.
Educate Girls currently operates successfully in over 20,000+ villages in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. By leveraging the Government’s existing investment in schools and by engaging with a huge base of community volunteers, Educate Girls helps to identify, enrol and retain out-of-school girls and to improve foundational skills in literacy and numeracy for all children (both girls and boys). This helps deliver measurable results to a large number of children and avoids parallel delivery of services.SPARKS works tirelessly to keep children in school, through holistic interventions that impact the community. 
In just 14 years, SPARKS has transformed the lives of over 1.5 million women and children.</h3>
